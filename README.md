# Learn Svelte Vite

A web application built with **Svelte** and **Vite**, covering fundamental to advanced concepts of Svelte development. This project serves as a learning resource to understand reactive programming and state management in Svelte.

## Features
- Project setup with **Vite**
- Component-based architecture
- Reactive state management
- Props and event handling
- Conditional rendering with **if, each, and await blocks**
- Style binding and scoped styling
- Animation and transitions
- Global state management using **store**
- Lifecycle hooks for better component control
- Context API for shared state across components

## Tech Stack
- **Svelte** (Latest stable version)
- **Vite** for fast development and build
- **Store API** for state management
- **CSS Modules** for styling components

## Requirements
Before running this project, make sure you have:
- **Node.js** (Latest LTS version recommended)
